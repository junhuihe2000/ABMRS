\arguments{
\item{x}{a numeric matrix, (m,2), each row indicates a predictor value (x_1,x_2).}

\item{y}{a numeric vector, indicates the response values,
the same length as x's rows.}

\item{gamma}{double, the exponent in extended BIC, default value is \code{1.0}.
It should be contained in \verb{[0,1]} (Nevertheless, outside is valid).}

\item{c}{double, the constant affects the proposal distribution in MCMC,
default value is \code{0.3}. It has to be contained in \verb{[0,1]}.}

\item{times_1}{double, decides the number of all potential knots in x_1 if \code{n_1<0}.
In this case, \code{n_1} is \code{length(x) * times}, default value is \code{3.0}.}

\item{times_2}{double, similar to \code{times_1} but in x_2, default value is \code{3.0}.}

\item{k_1}{int, the number of knots in x_1 is fixed if \code{k_1>0}. Otherwise \code{k_1} will
be estimated in the algorithm, default value is \code{-1}.}

\item{k_2}{int, the number of knots in x_2 is fixed if \code{k_2>0}. Otherwise \code{k_2} will
be estimated in the algorithm, default value is \code{-1}.}

\item{n_1}{int, the number of all potential knots in x_1, default value is \code{-1}.}

\item{n_2}{int, similar to \code{n_1} but in x_2, default value is \code{-1}.}

\item{degree_1}{int, the degree of polynomial spline in x_1, default value is \code{3}.}

\item{degree_2}{int, the degree of polynomial spline in x_2, default value is \code{3}.}

\item{intercept_1}{bool, whether the intercept is included in the basis in x_1,
default value is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{intercept_2}{bool, whether the intercept is included in the basis in x_2,
default value is \code{TRUE}.}
