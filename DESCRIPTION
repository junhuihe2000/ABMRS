Description: An algorithm for extended Bayesian adaptive regression splines. 
  We propose a fully Bayesian approach for knot inference in multivariate spline regression. 
  The knot inference is of interest in many problems, such as change point detection. 
  You can estimate the knot number and location simultaneously and accurately 
  by the proposed method in univariate or multivariate splines.
